Swift Package Manager for iOS
The concept of a package is nothing new. Packages let you use third-party, open-source code with ease. They also make it easier to split your code into reusable, logical chunks you can easily share across your projects, or indeed with the entire world. :]
The Swift Package Manager, or SwiftPM, has been around since Swift 3.0. It was initially only available for server-side or command line Swift projects. Since the release of Swift 5 and Xcode 11, SwiftPM is compatible with the iOS, macOS and tvOS build systems for creating apps. This is great news for app developers because they can now unleash its power on their codebases!
A package is simply a collection of Swift source code files and a metadata, or manifest, file called Package.swift that defines various properties about the package, such as its name and any code dependencies it has.
